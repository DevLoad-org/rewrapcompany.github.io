        <h5 class="small-header">Exchanges & Returns</h5><br>
        We invest a great deal of time and care in curating and upcycling our products. As a company policy we do not provide refund on any product sold. Once the REWRAP pieces are sold they can be exchanged for replacement or a credit note (provided the aforementioned terms and conditions are met). If for some reason, we’ve missed an issue spot and you’d like to exchange/ return them, you can write to us at support@rewrap.store and someone from our customer care team will contact you within 1-2 business days and will guide you through the process of returning and exchanging the REWRAP pieces. They may request for further information / photographs to assess your return request. Please do assist them.
      </div><br>
      <div id="rs-disclaimer">
        <h5 class="small-header">Disclaimer</h5><br>
        Please note that not all products are eligible for exchange. All made-to-order and upcycled products are non-returnable and non-exchangeable. In order to maintain fairness to our Sellers, as well as keep our prices fair, many items are "Final Sale." Please make it a point to understand which products are eligible for returns before purchasing.
      </div><br>
      <div id="rs-return">
        <h5 class="small-header">How to Return?</h5><br>
        We accept returns, solely at our discretion, on damaged on unusable products. You must inform us within 3 days of delivery of the product to you with proof of such damage of the Product. Please send us an email to support@rewrap.store with your order number and attach an image of the piece purchased. Once you have mailed us, we will provide you with the address to which the Product has to be shipped. The cost for shipping the product back to us is to be borne by you. For all International exchanges and returns, the customer will have to bear all shipping charges as well as customs charges if applicable.
        Please ensure that the product is in its original condition and packaging. Item(s) which show signs of wear and/or being worn before will not be eligible for returns or exchanges. We would require all original papers to be returned with the product. REWRAP reserves all rights to inspect the condition of the product before processing any returns or exchanges. As a company policy we do not provide refund on any product sold. Once the REWRAP pieces are sold they can be exchanged for replacement with a credit note (provided the aforementioned terms and conditions are met). All custom made and up-cycling orders are non- returnable.
      </div><br>
      <div id="rs-international">
        <h5 class="small-header">International Orders</h5><br>
        We don't do free international shipping. The cost of the courier needs to be borne by the customer. Your card will be charged when your payment is confirmed and subsequently the package will be shipped to its final international destination. We try our best to ship our REWRAP pieces to you within 2 weeks. The shipping time for customized orders and out of stock products would however be longer and we would keep you posted about the approximate delivery date post ordering as well. These delivery times are subject to location, distance and our logistics partners.
        You may be charged for handling fees and taxes as your order passes through customs. Any charges on a parcel must be paid by the person receiving the parcel (this also applies to retail & wholesale customers). REWRAP has no control over these charges and we can’t tell you what the cost would be, as customs policies and import duties vary widely from country to country. It might be a good idea to contact your local customs office for current charges before you order, so you are not surprised by charges you were not expecting.
